# A React Form

This is a basic example of a React application that includes a simple form component. The form allows users to input their name, email address and password and submit the data. The form also includes validation for each field. The form component is reusable and can be used in any React application.

## Built With

This project is built with the following technologies:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I chose React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, which allows to create a dynamic and interactive web application.
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React component for faster and easier web development. It provides pre-designed UI components and styles that follow the Material Design guidelines, saving time and effort in creating a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application components. I have used CSS to customize the appearance of the application, ensuring it aligns with our design and branding.

## Folder Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application. This directory holds all the code responsible for rendering our web application.
  - `assets/`: Contains any static assets like images or fonts. These assets are used to enhance the visual elements of the application and can be easily referenced in our code.
  - `components/`: Contains React components, including the form component. React components are the building blocks of the UI. They encapsulate the logic and presentation of different parts of the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
  - `pages/`: Contains pages or route components. Pages represent distinct views or routes within our application. Each page may include multiple components and is responsible for rendering a specific part of the app.
  - `App.css`: CSS file for styling the main application component. This file contains styles that are specific to the top-level component of the application, ensuring consistent and cohesive styling.
  - `App.jsx`: The main application component. This component serves as the entry point for the application and typically includes the overall layout and routing setup.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles. These styles affect the entire application and can be used for global theming or styling that applies across all components.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point of the application. This file initializes the React application and renders the root component, starting the execution of the web app.
