# A React Form

This is a basic example of a React application that includes a simple form component. The form allows users to input their name, email address and password and submit the data. The form also includes validation for each field. The form component is reusable and can be used in any React application.

## Getting Started

To run this React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/udkfer/form.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd form
```
3. Install the required  dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

## Built With

This project is built with the following technologies:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application components.

## Folder Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - `assets/`: Contains any static assets like images or fonts.
  - `components/`: Contains React components, including the form component.
  - `pages/`: Contains pages or route components.
  - `App.css`: CSS file for styling the main application component.
  - `App.jsx`: The main application component.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point of the application.

## Acknowledgments and Future

- This project is on going and will be updated as I learn more about React.
- Currently, I'm using an example [JSON API](https://randomuser.me/api) for the user database. In the near future, I plan to create a NestJS project to serve as both an API and database.
